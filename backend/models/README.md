# Models Directory

This folder should contain the trained Pickle (.pkl) models:

1. `agricultural_model.pkl`: Model for field crops.
2. `horticultural_model.pkl`: Model for fruits/vegetables.
3. `zone_classifier.pkl`: Optional model for climatic zone classification.

Run the training scripts (e.g., in `ml/`) to generate these files.
