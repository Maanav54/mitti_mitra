# Data Directory

This folder should contain:
1. `training/kaggle_crop_dataset.csv`: The dataset used to train the ML models.
2. `real_world/sensor_aggregated_data.csv`: Backup of locally aggregated sensor readings.

Note: These files are not generated by the code generation script as they are binary/data assets.
